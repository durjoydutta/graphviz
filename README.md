# GraphVizDFS: Visualizing DFS & Topological Sorting of Graphs with Graphviz

## 📌 Overview
GraphVizDFS is a Python-based tool that helps visualize **Depth First Search (DFS)** and **Topological Sorting** of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) using the `graphviz` library. It enables clear, structured representations of graphs and their traversal orders.

## 🚀 Features
- 📍 **Graph Visualization:** Generates a directed graph from an adjacency list.
- 🔄 **DFS Traversal:** Displays DFS traversal order on the graph.
- 📊 **Topological Sorting:** Orders nodes based on topological sort and highlights them.
- 📈 **Left-to-Right Layout:** Arranges nodes in topological order for better readability.


## 🛠 Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install Graphviz and its Python wrapper:

```bash
pip install graphviz
```

You may also need to install Graphviz separately:

- **Windows:**
  - Download from https://Graphviz.org
  
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt install graphviz
```
- **Mac (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install graphviz
```
